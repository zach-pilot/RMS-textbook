# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello and welcome to Dr. Pilot's Research Methods and Statistics courses. This online textbook is a companion to the in class experience. It was created as a tool you can use when you're at home to practice R, review terms, and prepare for upcoming evaluations.

This text will cover the following topics and more:

-   Installing and setting up R on your device

-   Basic R vocabulary and use

-   Manipulating data

-   Visualizing data

-   Research design

-   Research methods

-   Measurement

-   Univariate analysis

-   (some) Multivariate analysis

Finally, this is a living text, it is incomplete. There will be typos, inelegant language, and sometimes things may not appear the way I intend. Just let me know so I can improve it.

*This book began as a collaboration between Dr. Pilot, Liam Murray, and Jacob Lucas.*
