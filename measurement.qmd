## Measurement

**Measurement Error**

Variability in scores due to factors that distort the true score.

**True Score**

The score a participant would obtain if a measure were perfect and we could measure without error.

Measurement error + True Score = Observed score

## Sources of Measurement Error

**Transient States**

Temporary state

*Ex. mood*

**Stable Attribute**

A lasting state

*Ex. Ambitious personality*

**Situational factor**

Research setting (Ex. Noise/temperature in the room)

**Characteristics of the measure**

The measure itself is ambiguous or too long

**Mistakes in recording**

Incorrect data

## Reliability

Consistency/dependability of the measuring technique

Inverse relationship with measurement error

If observed score is close to the true score, your measure has high reliability

Can be assessed using several measurements of the same behavior and comparing to see if they resulted in similar scores (typically through a correlation)

**Correlation Coefficient**

Value that describes relationship between two measures

Ranges from -1.00 to +1.00, sign indicates direction

Correlation of .00 indicates no relationship

## Forms of Reliability

**Inter-rater Reliability**

Consistency among two or more researchers who observe and record participants’ behavior

**Test-Retest Reliability**

Consistency of responses on a measure over time, use the same measure twice and evaluate the correlation.

The results of a reliable measure should not change over time.

**Inter-Item Reliability**

Consistency between items on a scale.

Tells the researcher whether the items on the scale are measuring the same thing

If the items do not measure the same thing, measurement error increases and reliability decreases.

## Indices of Inter-Item Reliability

**Item-total correlation**

The correlation between one item and the sum of all other items on a scale.

**Split-half reliability**

Divide items on a scale into two sections and examine the correlation between the sections.

**Cronbach’s Alpha (α)**

The average of all possible split-half reliabilities

Most frequently used

α \> .70 considered acceptable

## Increasing Reliability

Standardize how measure is administered

Clarify instructions and questions

Train researchers/coders

Minimize errors in coding data

## Validity

How accurate is a measure at estimating what it is attempting to assess?

Do differences in scores truly reflect differences in what you are trying to measure?

## Forms of Validity

**Face Validity**

The extent to which an assessment appears to describe what it is supposed to measure.

Does not actually impact the “true” validity

**Construct Validity**

How well does a measurement of a hypothetical construct relate to other measures.

-   **Hypothetical Construct**

    -   Something that cannot be directly observed, but is inferred based on observation or experience.

    -   *Ex. Personality, Confidence*

**Convergent Validity**

A measure correlates with other measures that it should correlate with

**Discriminant Validity**

A measure does not correlate with other measures that it should not correlate with

## Bias

**Test Bias**

When the validity of a measure is lower for some groups than others.
