## Samples vs. Populations

Though most behavioral science uses samples to test hypotheses, those hypotheses are almost always about populations.

A sample is not a perfect representation of a population, so any statistics you calculate for that sample are also not representative of the population. They are approximations.

[**Sampling Error**]{.underline}

The difference between sample statistics and population parameters.

## Sampling Distributions

[**Sampling Distribution**]{.underline}

A distribution of statistics of all possible samples of a given size from a population

One example of a sampling distribution is…..

[**Distribution of Sample Means**]{.underline}

A collection of sample means for all possible random samples of a given size that could be obtained from a population.

A distribution of sample means should form a normal distribution, with most of the sample means grouping around the population mean if the number of scores in each sample is more than 30.

Larger samples are more representative of populations than smaller samples.

The mean of the distribution of sample means is the always same as the population mean.

## Standard Error of the Mean

The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is the

[**Standard Error of the Mean**]{.underline}

𝜎𝑀= 𝜎𝑛√ 𝜎 M =

𝜎 n

## Z-score for a Sample

By using a sampling distribution you can calculate the location of an entire sample within a population

z = M - µ

σM
