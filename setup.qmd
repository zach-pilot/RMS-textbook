R is used in this course for several reasons.

-   It is free, so people create things for it that we can use for free.

-   Students can have it on any and all personal devices.

-   It is widely used in research, industry, and elsewhere.

-   It has great visualization tools.

-   The understanding of data and how it is manipulated is fundamental to understanding statistics.

Now that we are convinced, lets get R on all of our personal devices.

When we say R, we are often referring to both R and R Studio. R studio is a program that makes R much easier to use, and that's usually what we're referring to...but we need R for R Studio to work.

## Download R

R typically has a major update once a year and several smaller updates throughout the year. When these come out you have to download all of your packages again, but it's good to keep it updated. [Link to download R](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

## Download R Studio

We will do all of our work in R Studio, download it [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), after base R has been downloaded. It also has several updates a year, but it doesn't change anything about the packages so keep it updated.

## R Studio Overview

Once you open Rstudio you might notice that there are four different panes on your screen that each look different from the other. Although it might look overwhelming these panes are all important when operating in Rstudio and will all be used.

### Console Frame

The console frame is the **bottom left frame on your screen**. The console is like a scrap piece of paper or and etch an sketch, its a great place to do some troubleshooting or viewing data through the `glimpse()` function but **any work you do here will not be saved.** To run your code in the console frame you type the code and press the `enter` or `return` key. You can also see output from your code directly in this frame. T

he console is also next to the terminal which is the tab right next to it. **They both can run commands but are different in nature**.The *console* is intended to run commands that work mainly inside Rstudio itself. The *terminal* however runs systems commands like something you do on your computer.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/R_console_screenshot.png")
```

### Source Frame

The source frame or editor frame is **the top left frame** on your screen. This frame is the primary location of where you will be doing your work and typing all of your code. The source frame is used to open RMarkdown documents, scripts, and other ways to type code. You can also save and open new documents and files at the farthest top left corner of this frame.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/source_screenshot_example.png")
```

### Environment/History

The environment or history frame can be seen in **the top right frame on your screen.** This is where you can view current objects that you have created which we will discuss further in the chapter as well as data sets and where you can track your steps by viewing the command history that you have run.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Environment_screenshot_example.png")
```

### Files/Packages

The last frame on **the bottom right is your files and packages** frame. This frame is more of a window into your computer in the sense that you are able to view the packages and files that you have on stored on it. You can also use it to check any plots you might have and to read any documents on your computer as well. You only need to download a package one time, then it is saved. However, every time you open Rstudio packages must be loaded into the R environment.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/files_screenshot_example.png")
```

**Suggestion**: If you wish to change the layout of your frames to customize it simply click **tools** at the top of your computer then **global options** then to pane layout to customize the layout to whatever is the best for you.

## Saving

Science should be reproducible, so should your work. When you close R and start a new session you will be starting from a blank slate unless you save your work.

By default, R will save your work in a **working directory**, The **working directory** is a location on your computer or the cloud. See where your things are being saved by typing `getwd()` in **the source pane** now. This is probably not a good place to save the *many* files we will be creating in this course. Instead, we will create an **R Studio Project**.

### R Studio Project

Follow the steps below to create an R Studio project where all of your things will be saved.

-   Above the console pane you will see several clickable buttons with green pluses on them. Click the second button from the left to create a new project.

-   Click "New Directory"

-   Click "New Project"

-   Name your project something like "rms" or "psy303"

-   Choose a sensible subdirectory by clicking the "Browse" button so you can find all of your files. I suggest your desktop on your device, not the cloud.

-   Click "Create Project"

    -   Now, you should notice in the top right of your screen the name of your project, indicating that you are working within that project.

Check your new working directory by typing `getwd()` in the source pane again, it should reflect your subdirectory and project name.

As long as this project is open everything you save, which we will get to in the sections below, will be placed in that working directory and you will have easy access to anything in that directory from R. We will be creating code documents in this class from a package called RMarkdown. But to get there we need to understand what packages are.

## Packages

Now that you are familiar with the R interface we will get into the things that make R run, packages.

### What is a package?

A package is where R gets its main power. Packages are compilations of data, functions, etc. that we must download from CRAN - the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Packages can contain lots of different things. They are most useful because they allow us to perform actions we can do with base R alone- which is just R without any packages downloaded.

### Installing and finding packages

There are two ways to install packages. Install both of these packages because we will be using them a lot.

1.  Via your files and packages pane.

    -   Click the packages tab in the Files/Packages pane

    -   Click the install button on the top left of that pane

    -   type "rmarkdown"

    -   click install

2.  Via code.

    -   click to the right of the `>` symbol in your bottom left console pane

    -   use the `install.packages()` function to install the desired package

    -   Once you are there you will type the following code. Do not be afraid if you see a warning in yellow that is perfectly normal.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### R Markdown

Now that we have R Markdown downloaded we are going to open a markdown document.

1.  Look to the upper left of the console pane, you should see a white page with a green plus arrow over top of it. Click it.

2.  In the dropdown menu click "R Markdown".

3.  You will be prompted to name your document - usually you want this to be obvious and helpful. For now, call it "fundamentals"

Your document should open and it will be automatically filled with some stuff. Do not be alarmed, you can do many things in R Markdown, but we will start out slow.

#### Source/Visual Editor

Above the document itself, just under the save icon, you should see the words "Source" and "Visual". These are buttons that change your view from the source code view and a rendered view that works more like Microsoft Word.

Click back and forth.You should notice some differences. What is most important for us is the use of `##`. These tell Markdown to make a header. It's super useful when organizing your code.

We will be staying in the Source editor.

#### YAML Header

At the very top of the document you see a YAML header, this formats your document. For now, we will leave it be.

 ---  

title: "Untitled"  

author: "zp"  

date: "`r Sys.Date()`"  

output: html_document

 ---

#### Code Chunks

Immediately below the header is the first code chunk. Code chunks are placed within a Markdown document where code can be executed. Text outside of a code chunk is interpreted just like a word processor - so code doesn't work.

Code chunks always begin with \`\`\`{r}

and end with \`\`\`

You can name code chunks for organization, the first chunk in this markdown document is named "setup". The next thing, "include = false" tells markdown to do something specific with that code chunk. In this case, it's saying run this code in the background, but don't show the viewer.

Code chunks can be customized in various ways. For example, in this textbook I make lots of code visible, but I choose to hide the output.

In this class you should never have one incredibly long code chunk. They should be used to complete one specific task that is explained via the word processing and then moving on to the next task and repeating the process.

To create a code chunk you can click the green C with button to the top right of the Source frame or you can use the keyboard shortcut `option` + `command` + `i`.

When code is typed into a code chunk it doesn't run when you press `enter` like in the console. In RMarkdown you are writing a kind of script - code that is meant to be executed all at once at the end. However, that's not how people work. Often, you will need to run the current chunk you are working on. When working in Markdown the code chunks you create have acccess to any object you have saved in the environment and any package you have loaded that session. There are two ways run code in R markdown.

1.  Press the little green play button in the top right corner of the code chunk.
2.  Click anywhere in the code you want to run and use the keyboard shortcut `shift` + `command` + `return`

#### Text

Just below the code chunk we see \## R Markdown. This tells markdown to make a second level header named R markdown. We can see this if we switch to the Visual editor.

Just below that is normal text.

That's all we need to understand for now. When you open these documents you can delete everything but the YAML header. So let's do that now and use the Markdown file you created for the remainder of this chapter and the fundamentals chapter.

### Loading packages

When you download a package it is on your computer until you delete it or until you update R. However, when you start a new session you will not have access to that function, the package will need to be loaded. In order to use the functions within a package you must load it into the R environment every single time. For us, that means the first code chunk of our R Markdown files is just loading in the packages we will need for that document.

Packages are loaded into the environment by using the the `library()` function. It will not work if you do not have the package installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Once you have successfully loaded the tidyverse into your current session you should get the following result in your console:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Tidyverse_load_example.png")
```

**THIS IS OK IT MEANS YOU HAVE SUCCESFULLY LOADED YOUR PACKAGE**

Sometimes you will need to update your packages. You can do this by executing the code below in your console or within a markdown document or you can click the green update button in the packages pane.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
update.packages()
```

To see what packages you have installed you can either go to the bottom right pane and find the packages tab to find a list of all packages and which are installed. Or you could also run this code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
installed.packages()
```
