Although it might look overwhelming these panes are all important when operating in Rstudio and will all be used\n\n2.2.1 2.2.1 Console Frame\nThe console frame is the bottom left frame on your screen. This is where you will be viewing some of your code. You can also see outputs from your code directly in this frame and is one location of where you will be trouble shooting as well. Think of this frame as a chat box in R in order to see behind the scenes of what you will be running. You should make note that the console is like a scrap piece of paper or and etch an sketch its a great place to do some troubleshooting or viewing data through the glimpse() function but any work you do here will not be saved. The console is also next to the terminal which is the tab right next to it. They both can run commands but are different in nature.The console is intended to run commands that work mainly inside Rstudio itself. The terminal however runs systems commands like something you do on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 2.2.2 Source Frame\nThe source frame or editor frame is the top left frame on your screen. This frame is the primary location of where you will be doing your work and typing all of your code. When you create a new code chunk you will do that in the source frame. You should be able to see all the lines and numbers of each code line. You can also save and open new documents and files at the farthest top left corner of this frame. Opening your Rmarkdown files like you created in chapter 1 is a great way to practice using the source frame and where you will do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 2.2.3 Environment/History\nThe environment or history frame can be seen in the top right frame on your screen. This is where you can view current objects that you have created which we will discuss further in the chapter as well as data sets and where you can track your steps by viewing the command history that you have run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 2.2.4 Files/Packages\nThe last frame on the bottom right is your files and packages frame. This frame is more of a window into your own computer itself in the sense that you are able to view the packages and files that you have on your current computer. You can also use it to check any plots you might have and to read any documents on your computer as well. You only will need to download a package one time but whenever you open Rstudio you will need to load it up every time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion: If you wish to change the layout of your frames to customize it simply click tools at the top of your computer then global options then to pane layout to customize the layout to whatever is the best for you.",

    "text": "2.3 2.3 Packages and the tidyverse\nNow that you are familiar with where you can view and access your packages we will now take a closer look as to what they are and different tips fro them as well as introducing you to a very useful package that will make writing code much easier and it is called the tidyverse.\n\n2.3.1 2.3.1 What is a package?\nYou might be wondering how we are going to be using something that you typically get in the mail on your computer. In R a package is where R gets its main power from. We have packages because just like in real life they contain something. In R packages can contain a multitude of functions, data, and documents.\n\n\n2.3.2 2.3.2 Installing and finding packages\nWhenever you want to install a package you will have to run a command. When you are working in a document you will need to load your packages each time or else your code will not run because the package has not been reloaded. You can install packages by going to your console frame in the bottom left. Once you are there you will type the following code. Do not be afraid if you see a warning in yellow that is perfectly normal.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nThen to load it into your active session the first thing you always want to do is to load it into your session. You will want to do this by running the following in your source frame or the top left. We do this by using the the library function which calls up any package that you have installed it will not work if you do not have the package installed.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nOnce you have successfully loaded the tidyverse into your current session you should get the following result in your console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS OK IT MEANS YOU HAVE SUCCESFULLY LOADED YOUR PACKAGE\nNow sometimes you will need to update your packages because if you don’t it can cause them to not load and your code will not run. If this happens all you will have to do is run this code.\n\nupdate.packages()\n\nTo see what packages you have installed you can either go to the bottom right pane and find the packages tab to find a list of all packages and which are installed. Or you could also run this code.\n\ninstalled.packages()\n\n\n\n2.3.3 2.3.3 The Tidyverse\nNow that you have successfully installed the tidyverse we can examine it and what it does. When thinking about the tidyverse the best way to explain it is think of it like a universe. A universe is a space that contains different things like planets which contain different things like people. Well just like a universe the tidyverse contains a large amount of packages inside of it that are meant to make using R easier and work more efficiently. All the packages inside the tidyverse all share a common philosophy and syntax. Think of it like the world having america and how we all share a common philosophy and syntax. The packages in the tidyverse work the same way. Because all of these functions use the same grammar it makes it easier for us to read R code. Take a look at this example\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Example of data transformation\nstarwars %&gt;% \n  select(name, height, mass, species) %&gt;% \n  filter(species == \"human\") %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(mass))",

A function is a command that begins an action this is a basic example of a function\n\nfunction_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2)\n\n\n2.4.1 2.4.1 Applied Functions\nThe function is made up of two arguments that we give values to.\nNext we can look at a basic function called the combine function or it can be viewed as this c(). It takes every value we have in the function and applies it to all of them. This can be used for mathematical purposes when using Rstudio like a calculator. Lets take a look at an example\n\nmean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) \n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAs you can see we get the output after and we can see the answer is 3. We ran this function and all the values were applied to each other while we also utilized the mean function combining two functions.\n\n\n2.4.2 2.4.2 Creating Functions\nCreating your own function is a very useful skill because it allows you to easily apply values to data without you having to type it out over and over again. In order to create a function you must name it then assign it a value by using the &lt;- symbol. This assigns whatever you write to that name which then should appear in the top right frame or your environment frame.\n\nplus_two &lt;- function(x) {\n  x + 2\n}\n\nplus_two(5)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nAs you see we created the function plus_two Which will take whatever is in our function and add 2 to it so when we use the function and put 5 in there it takes 5 and already adds the two to it.\n\n\n2.4.3 2.4.3 Assignment operator\nWhenever we want to assign a value to something we need to use the &lt;- symbol. This will then take whatever we assign to the value we create. As you can see in the example above the function we created was assigned to the value plus_two because we used the assignment operator to give it that value.\n\n\n2.4.4 2.4.4 Arguments\nWhen we are using functions we must also know that we are dealing with arguments as well. An argument is the information that we put into a function so the function knows what to do with it. So think of the function like a machine and the arguments are the ingredients that we give it.\n\nmean(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n\nAs you can see here the mean is the function we are using and the argument is everything inside of the parenthesis.",

So if we want to combine a bunch of names we can use a vector to do so but they need to all be the same type of data. Which we will go over the different types of data later in the chapter. Here are some simple basic examples of a vector\n\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\nnames &lt;- c(\"Adam\", \"Steven\", \"James\")\n\nNow once we have these saved we can use them again if we want since we have combined them all into one vector.\n\nnumbers\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 2.5.2 Data Frames\nA data frame is a different way of creating data. When you use a data frame think of it like a window frame. In a data frame the data is arranged into a rectangular shape and uses rows and columns. The columns in a data frame are called variables and the rows in our data frame are called observations. Now we can use data frames to combine two different types of data into one output.\n\ndata.frame(\n  name = c(\"James\", \"Henry\"),\n  age = c(21,67),\n  sport = c(\"Baseball\", \"Soccer\")\n)\n\n   name age    sport\n1 James  21 Baseball\n2 Henry  67   Soccer\n\n\nYou can see our output of how the data is arranged into the order that we make it to where the same location is applied so that they go in order. You can also see at the bottom of the output where it displays the number of rows that we have.\n\n\n2.5.3 2.5.3 Tribbles\nA tribble is short for transposed tibble and it is a different way to create small data frames.\n\nlibrary(tibble)\n\npeople &lt;- tribble(\n  ~name,   ~age, ~city,\n  \"James\",  21,   \"Evansville\",\n  \"Hunter\", 38,   \"Toledo\"\n)\npeople\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  name     age city      \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 James     21 Evansville\n2 Hunter    38 Toledo    \n\n\nNow you can see our tribble fully completed with both rows and columns where you can see in the bottom of the output that the tribble shows the rows. It also tells us the type of data that we are seeing in the output which you will learn more about later in the chapter.\n\n\n2.5.4 2.5.4 Glimpse\nWhen you want to examine the characteristics of your data you can use glimpse to get more information about it. It provides the full data for your set and gives all the details you could need.\n\nglimpse(people)\n\nRows: 2\nColumns: 3\n$ name &lt;chr&gt; \"James\", \"Hunter\"\n$ age  &lt;dbl&gt; 21, 38\n$ city &lt;chr&gt; \"Evansville\", \"Toledo\"\n\n\nLook at the output above you can see next to name the &lt;chr&gt; that means the column contains data that is characters. The one below that is the &lt;dbl&gt; so you can see that is double data. This shows us that vectors simple a column of names and values that are the same type.",

Usually in R when we run multiple functions we would have to think of the output like a boat going through a river. Normally we would have to manually open each bridge in order for it to pass through to the next part of the river. The pipe makes it easier for us by doing that automatically. So whenever we are running multiple functions in a code chunk we use the pipe to channel the output right into the next function without having to do the work ourselves. In the tidyverse the pipe is represented as %&gt;% which can be easily created with the shortcut command + shift + m. Now lets look at an example of how the pipe works.\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  group_by(cyl) %&gt;% \n  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see in the output now that in our pipe we took the car data set then funneled in the function of grouping cars by their cylinders then taking that output and funneling it into finding the average miles per gallon which creates our final output.\nNow try running the same code without the use of the pipe and see if it still works.",

These are pretty common and are just regular numbers that can be represented differently. When looking at an output in R we can see if the data we are looking at is numeric by looking for how it is abbreviated which is by num. Whenever we see a column whit this title we know the data in that column is numeric. You can use the typeof() function in R to see exactly what type of data you are dealing with.\n\ntypeof(42)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(FALSE)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\ntypeof(\"jack\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n2.8.2 2.8.2 Character data\nCharacter data is words that we use in R that are not functions but represent something in the data we are dealing with. These could be examples like names in a data set that represent something. It is important to note though we can tell if the data is a character because it must always be in \"\". This shows that it is just text we are dealing with and not some function. The abbreviation for character data in R is chr. So whenever you see a column with chr you know the data in it is character data.\n\n    my_vector &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n    str(my_vector)\n\n\n\n2.8.3 2.8.3 Logical data\nLogical data is a type of Boolean data in the sense that it can only represent one of two values. This means that when we look at logical data we are looking to see if something is either true or false. Kind of like in real life when we use logic to see if we believe something or not. So in R logical data will be represented as either TRUE or FALSE. It is important that they are all capitalized so they cannot be confused for something else. The abbreviations in R are simple because it will either be T or F.\n\n# Assigning logical values using full names\nbool1 &lt;- TRUE\nbool2 &lt;- FALSE\n\n# Assigning logical values using abbreviations\nbool3 &lt;- T\nbool4 &lt;- F\n\n\n\n2.8.4 2.8.4 Factor data\nIn R we refer to factor data as the type of categories that variables are stored as a factor. It works with variables that have a fixed and already known set of possible values. We use factor data differently depending on the data we are trying to use. We use factor() to create a new factor from a vector. We use as.factor() to move an object like a character list into a vector. is.factor() is when we want to check if an object is already a factor.\n\nclass(factor(c(\"Low\"), \"High\"))\n\n\n\n2.8.5 2.8.5 Double data\nDouble data is how we refer to data that are numbers but not whole numbers. Not to be confused with numeric data double data deals with decimals that are numbers. This can be represented as dbl. So this tells us that whenever we see a column that has that list it means that we are dealing with numbers but they are decimals and not whole numbers",

    "text": "4.0.1 Experimental Research\nAllows us to study causes of behavior.\n\n\n4.0.2 Three components of Experimental Research\n\nManipulate a variable\n\nExercise experimental control\n\nSystematically put participants in groups\n\nEnsure equivalent groups\n\nControl extraneous variables\n\nMake sure factors that are unimportant don’t influence results\n\n\n\n\n4.0.3 Independent variable (IV)\nThe variable that the researcher manipulates. All experimental research must have AT LEAST one. Researchers can manipulate the environment, the instructions, or they may use an invasive variable (like giving someone a caffeine pill).\nMust have at least 2 levels\nEx. Temperature may have two levels; hot and cold\n\n\n4.0.4 Subject (Participant) Variables\nBased off of a personal characteristic. Something you cannot manipulate in the lab.\nEx. Ethnicity/Race, Hobbies\n\n\n4.0.5 Evaluating Your Independent Variable\nA bad independent variable can result in a failed experiment.\nPilot Study\nTest your experiment on a small group of people to ensure that it works.\nManipulation Check\nDone to ensure that the level of your IV manipulation is strong enough.\nEx. Is 5mg of caffeine enough or should I use 10mg?\n\n\n4.0.6 Dependent Variable\nThe variable a researcher measures.\nExperiments must have AT LEAST one.\nEx. Heart rate, response to questionnaire, performance on test\n\n\n4.0.7 Groups in an Experiment\nExperimental\nThe group that receives the independent variable manipulation.\nEx. In a study about sleep, this group is required to stay awake for 2 days.\nControl\nThe group that is not exposed to any independent variable manipulation.\nEx. In the same sleep study, this group sleeps however much they usually sleep.\n\n\n4.0.8 Assigning Participants\nSimple Random Assignment\nEveryone has an equal chance of being assigned to any group/condition.\nEx. Roll dice\nIn this situation people with any attribute are equally likely to be in either group.\nMatched Random Assignment\nParticipants are matched into homogeneous blocks. Participants in each block are then randomly assigned to conditions.\nIn this situation conditions will be similar along specific dimensions.\n\n\n4.0.9 Within Subject Designs (repeated measures)\nParticipants are exposed to ALL conditions in an experiment.\nNo need for random assignment.\nEx. In an experiment testing a new drug all participants receive all doses of the drug (5mg, 10mg, 15mg)\nPros\nMore powerful\nCons\nOrder Effects\n\n\n4.0.10 Power\nThe ability to detect IV effects.\nRequires fewer participants.\n\n\n4.0.11 Order Effects\nCarryover effects\nOne condition influences the following condition.\nPractice effects\nParticipants have learned how to perform from previous experimental trials.\nFatigue effects\nParticipants are tired, bored, have no energy over time.\nSensitization\nParticipants realize the hypothesis being tested and do not perform naturally.\n\nCounterbalancing\ncan be used to correct for order effects.\nA researcher presents the levels of the IV in different orders for different participants.\n\n\n4.0.12 Between-Subjects Design (Independent Measures)\nParticipants experience only one condition of the IV.\nTypically requires random assignment.\nEx. In an experiment testing a new drug each participant will receive only one of the three levels of drug dosage (5mg or 10 mg or 15 mg).\n\n\n4.0.13 Experimental Control\nTreatment effect\nSystematic differences due to the IV\nConfounds\nVariable other than the IV that differs systematically between conditions.\nConfounds invalidate your experiment because, if confounds are present, it is unclear whether the observed differences are due to the IV or the confound.\nMust be eliminated to draw accurate conclusions.\nError\nUnsystematic effects due to extraneous (uncontrolled) variables.\n\n\n4.0.14 Sources of Error\nIndividual Differences\nTransient states\nEnvironmental factors\nDifferential treatment\nMeasurement error\n\n\n4.0.15 Types of Validity\nInternal Validity\nDegree to which we can draw accurate conclusions about the effects of the IV\nGain internal validity when all confounds are eliminated and you can conclude that the observed differences were due to the IV.\nHas experimental control.\nExternal Validity\nInverse relationship with internal validity\nThe greater experimental control in your experiment, the less likely it will be externally valid or generalizable to the “real world”.\nInternal validity is more critical and desirable than external validity.\n\n\n4.0.16 Threats to internal validity\nBiased assignment of participants\nOccurs when random assignment isn’t possible or doesn’t produce equivalent groups.\nDifferential attrition\nParticipants drop out of the experiment differently across levels of the IV.\nDemand Characteristics\nParticipants perform in the way they believe the experimenter wants them to.\nPlacebo Effects\nChange as the result of the mere suggestion of change.\nPretest sensitization\nExposure to pretest affects one IV level differently than another\nHistory\nExternal events that participants experience affect one level of the IV differently than another\nExperimenter expectancy effects\nExperimenter with certain expectations interacts with participants differently\n\n\n4.0.17 Reducing threats to validity\nDouble Blind Procedure\nThe researcher administering the IV and the participant both do not know what level of the IV is being administered.\nCan eliminate expectancy effects and demand characteristics",

A t-test is a inferential statistic that compares means while also making note of variability and sample sizes. There are different ways in psychology that we can use these tests.\n\n6.3.1 One-sample t-test\nWhen we want to compare one group against a known value like for example the population average this is when we will use a one-sample t-test because we are only taking one group and applying it to a value that is already known.\n\n\n6.3.2 Independent-sample t-test\nNow when we want compare two completely different groups like say for example gender using males and females this is where we will use the independent sample t-test because the two are independent from each other and results will not rely on the other.\n\n\n6.3.3 Paired t-test\nWe use a paired t-test when we want to examine one group that usually experiences a change so lets say for example we want to measure a groups stress levels before and after listening to music we would use a paired t-test\n\n\n6.3.4 Now lets practice creating a small data-set that we could see in a real study that you might do for your project.\nLets say a researcher wants to see if listening to calming music will help reduce stress. In the experiment stress is measured on a scale of 0-100.\nThe hypothesis for this example is that students who listen to music will report lower stress levels.\n\nstress_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  group = c(rep(\"Control\", 8), rep(\"Music\", 8)),\n  stress = c(75, 80, 78, 82, 79, 76, 81, 74, \n             60, 65, 62, 58, 63, 61, 59, 64)\n)",
